# Car For U


If you are in the market for a used car, look no further than Car For U. Instead of searching through multiple used car sales websites, Car For U imports data from several sites to display them all in one place.

# How It's Made:


## Tech Used: HTML, CSS, Javascipt, React, Redux, Python, Firebase

### Server:

When the Python script is ran, a Firebase Cloud Firestore database is populated with data from multiple used car sales websites. The script data scrapes the sites, looking for keywords such as the title of the car, make and model, year, etc. It also grabs the image associated with each vehicle.
